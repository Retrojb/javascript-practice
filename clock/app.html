<!-- We just need a single line of HTML to display the clocks container to the DOM
    The id being passed to the div also allows for the CSS to manipulate that specfic part of the DOM
    To run simply add the src script location to the HTML head, since its local its just the local file path
    The script is loaded in after the div because, the DOM is created and then we execute the script
    if the Script comes before the container it will return NULL because it is trying to execute something that
    at the current moment doesn't exist.
